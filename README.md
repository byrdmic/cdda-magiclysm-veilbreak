# Veilbreak

A lightweight patch mod for **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead** that sits on top of Magiclysm, removes overt fantasy monsters/species, and reframes magic as a Cataclysm-triggered anomaly.

Magiclysm's mechanics remain intact; only spawns, scenario framing, and selective flavour text are adjusted.

## Why Veilbreak?

Magiclysm's excellent spell systems come bundled with an assumed high-fantasy world—goblins, magical species, long-standing magical ecosystems—that clashes with a grounded modern-apocalypse tone.

Veilbreak lets you keep the depth and breadth of Magiclysm's spells, items, and schools while removing the fantasy creature layer and presenting magic as **newly real** after the Cataclysm.

## Features

- **Fantasy monster removal** via `MONSTER_BLACKLIST` and compatible overrides
- **Veilbreak scenario**: Magic was fiction pre-Cataclysm; the veil is now broken
- **Lore-consistent descriptions** for select Magiclysm items (no mechanical changes)
- **Patch, don't fork** strategy: blacklists and overrides only—no upstream file edits

## Installation

1. Ensure you have `magiclysm` installed
2. Copy this mod folder to your CDDA `mods` directory
3. Enable `Magiclysm – Veilbreak` at world creation (after enabling Magiclysm)

## Dependencies

- `dda` (base game)
- `magiclysm`

## What This Mod Does NOT Do

- Rebalance spells, mana, schools, or progression
- Remove or replace Magiclysm's existing professions/scenarios
- Add new magic systems, enemies, or factions
- Make any mechanical changes to Magiclysm content

## Compatibility

Designed to work with both stable and experimental CDDA builds. Updates to upstream Magiclysm should have minimal conflict since Veilbreak uses only patch-layer content.
